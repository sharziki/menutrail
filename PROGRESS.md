## Current Phase: Research ✅ → Setup

## Completed
- [x] Created GitHub repo (sharziki/menutrail)
- [x] Researched Owner.com (features, pricing, positioning)
- [x] Researched competitors (Square, GloriaFood, Toast)
- [x] Found key weakness: Owner.com has 2.8/5 on Trustpilot (data privacy concerns)
- [x] Identified our angle: "Canva of restaurant menus" - 6 unique layouts
- [x] Created PRODUCT.md with full competitive analysis

## In Progress
- [ ] Project scaffolding (Next.js 14 + Supabase + shadcn)

## Next Up
- [ ] Design system + component library
- [ ] Database schema
- [ ] Menu Builder - Layout 1: Grid

## Blocked

## Key Insights from Research

1. **Owner.com's weakness:** Data privacy issues, uses customer data to sell to competitors
2. **Market gap:** No one offers real menu customization - everyone looks the same
3. **Our hook:** 6 layout templates that make each restaurant unique
4. **Speed target:** 10 minutes from signup to accepting orders
5. **Pricing angle:** No customer fees (Owner charges 5% to customers)
